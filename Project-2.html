                <h2 class="introduction"> Introduction</h2>
                    
                    <p> This page will include a website redesign that I completed over the course of my 2024 summer internship at Prudential Financial, as well as other, smaller, assignments that I did. I had the pleasure of working in Prudential's US Business's Marketing Department for 10 weeks, where I worked cross functionally with teams in user research, design, branding, and engineering.

                <h2 class="problem-statement">  Problem Statement </h2>
                 <p> Prudential Financial is a successful life insurance company of 150 years. It's longevity has contributed to its trustworthy reputation, but has also given the company a stauchy feel. To stay on top of technology adn design trends, and to appeal to the next generation of life insurance owners, Prudential wanted to undergo a drastic change in branding. They wanted a new iconic brand that was modern and young, while still balancing aspects of Prudential's recognizatble and signature look, its commitment to accessibile software, and intential design.

                <h2>Research</h2>

               <p> Prudential boasts being customer obsessed- a trait that has led them to an Award-Winning Life Insurance Marketing Campaign. Much of my research was simply understanding the psyche of a Prudential customer- everything from their hobbies to financial habits. By putting myself in the shoes of a 55 year old looking to get life insurance before they retire gave me a better understanding of how to influence consumer behavior to make purchases or take action in a specific way. We interviewed hundreds of customers and organized notes onto reports like this: </p>

                <h2> Research 2.0</h2>

            <p> Now that we know the customers insdie and out, its time to do branding reserach.  One of the main aspects that I was researching  was typography. The intricate dance between typography and human psychology is a fascinating study that extends far beyond the mere selection of fonts for aesthetic appeal.
                The choice of font can profoundly influence the perception, emotion, and even the decision-making process of the reader. In the end, the decision came down to  whether to go for the reliable, bold, professional feel exuded by the all capital Prudential Modern font, or the welcoming, clean lines of a sans serif. The marketing team strongly advocated for consistant all caps, but were worried that the emotion it would evoke would be innapproproatie for, say, a 'file a claim for your recently deceased loved one' page. Every font choice carries with it a set of associations and emotional responses that can significantly affect how content is received. A mismatch between the font style and the content's tone can lead to confusion and dilute the intended message. Therefore, understanding the psychological implications of font choices is essential for enhancing the clarity and effectiveness of communication.</p>

                <h2> Design Rules</h2>
            <p>  The head of marketing gave us three key pillars that dictated the flow of the new branding designs: 
                1. No gradients. They can cause accessiblilty issues <br>
                2. No patterns. They were deemed outdated, unintentional, and can also cause readability issues when used as a background <br>
                3. Must use PRudential's new color palette and typography guides. <br>
            My goal was to mainly focus on implementing the new branding into the headers of the Pru.com website. With all the guidlines and my research in mind, here are some of the redesigns I did. </p>
